# CODEWARS
I use Codewars to keep my problem-solving/logic skills sharp.  Cataloging my old solutions lets me continuously evaluate and improve my approach to new problems. <br><hr>

#### I'm all about collaborating to get better.  If you're learning to code, grow a blog, or start an online business and you have any feedback, questions or suggestions - hit me up!<br><hr>

MODEVX is my documented journey of learning mobile-first software development and design patterns.  I appreciate you taking the time to check out my repo.  I welcome feedback of all kinds so feel free to reach out.  Visit [www.modevx.com](https://www.modevx.com) to read my blog and see the live versions of my practice projects.  You can also e-mail me at info@modevx.com.
